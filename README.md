## Repository Branches

This repository follows a standard branch management strategy with two main branches:

- `master` branch: This branch contains the final, stable versions of the project. It represents the production-ready state of the codebase. Commits in this branch are typically tagged with version numbers for releases.

- `develop` branch: This branch serves as the main branch for ongoing development. It is used to integrate and test new features before they are merged into the `master` branch. Development work takes place in this branch, and it may contain the latest changes and updates.

### Branching Strategy

When contributing to this project, it is recommended to follow the following branching strategy:

1. Create a new branch from the `develop` branch. Give the branch a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the changes you are working on. For example, if you are adding a new feature called "User Authentication," you can create a branch named `feature/user-authentication`.

2. Commit and push your changes to the feature branch. Make sure to provide clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you have made.

3. Once your changes are ready for review, submit a pull request to merge your feature branch into the `develop` branch. The pull request will undergo code review and any necessary adjustments before being merged.

4. After thorough testing and validation in the `develop` branch, a decision will be made to merge the changes into the `master` branch for a production release. This is typically done during release cycles or when a significant set of features is ready.

### Branches Overview

- `master`: Contains the final, stable versions of the project. This branch should be used for production releases only.

- `develop`: The main branch for ongoing development. It contains the latest updates and serves as the integration branch for new features.

By following this branching strategy, we ensure a structured and controlled development process while keeping the `master` branch clean and stable for production releases.

**Note:** It's important to note that the branch names mentioned above are just examples, and you can adapt them to suit your specific project requirements and conventions.
